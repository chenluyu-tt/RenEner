# Renewable Energy Data Analysis 🔋📊

This is a self-driven data analysis and simulation project focused on **renewable energy usage and electricity savings**. It combines my passion for environmental sustainability with my growing skills in data science and machine learning.

## 🌱 Why I Started This Project

I grew up next to a wastewater treatment plant. From a very young age, I witnessed the consequences of environmental pollution, and I deeply understand how important it is to **save energy and protect the environment**.

When I came across open datasets related to electricity usage and renewable generation, I felt an urge to **apply my knowledge in Python and machine learning** to explore how we might **optimize energy use** in real-world settings.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

This project includes:
- 📊 Data analysis and simulation of energy savings using renewable sources (wind, solar)
- 🏭 Case studies: **Steel factory**, **data center**,Suzhou Case， and general use cases
- 📈 Visualizations including heatmaps and performance comparisons
- 🧠 A 64+-page report summarizing findings, simulation logic, and insights
- 💡 Exploration of machine learning applications in forecasting and cost optimization

The simulation explores how different setups (PV capacity, battery configuration, seasonal demand) can influence **energy savings**, aiming to inform smarter energy planning in industry.

## 🚀 What's Next

- 🏢 I plan to look for **companies working in this field** — especially those using data to **simulate and optimize energy systems**
- 💻 Alternatively, I may **develop the simulator further on my own**
- 🔍 I hope to refine the model using **more robust datasets**, and eventually turn it into a tool that real users (or industries) can benefit from

Currently, I haven’t found a commercial product that does exactly what this simulator attempts. So this might become a unique contribution — or at least a learning journey worth continuing.
